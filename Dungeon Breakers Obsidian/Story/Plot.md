**Break the dungeon, before dungeon breaks you.**

You wake up in a dark cave, you don't know who you are, or how you got there. Your only way out is to push forward as quickly as possible to leave this damned place (first level  "The Damned Place"). To do this, you must enrich your equipment and choose your development path. You must choose who you want to be. As the game progresses, the climate becomes more and more dark, the enemies become more demanding, and you feel worse and worse. When finally, after defeating countless creatures, you manage to find the path leading to the exit, you encounter a formidable obstacle. The first boss, which I don't know yet (maybe The Cursed One). When you finally defeat him after a fierce battle, you are met with an unpleasant surprise. The boss did not guard the exit from the cave, but the stairs leading to a higher level.

The idea of the plot is that as time goes on, the player should be less and less convinced that the title cave is actually a cave. It's about the inner battle that takes place in every person. The cave is supposed to represent the psyche, full of dark corners, secrets and traps. On the other hand, the enemies represent the demons we have to face, which are so close to us. The last battle that the player will face will be with a boss who will be him, only deformed and difficult to recognize. There is an option that when we win this balanced duel, we return to the starting point.
