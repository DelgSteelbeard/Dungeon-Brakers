This room is an armory it holds couple of different armaments. In the red circles appear to be some sort of eggs (spider eggs). In the green circle a hole, it can be assumed spiders come from there so it probably leads to a nest. The room is covered in cobwebs and is littered with bodies warped in webs. The blood trail that had begun in the room [[10]] ends here near the hole.

### Doors
1. Double metal grate doors, they are locked. The key can be found on one of the corpses present in the room [[10]]. The doors are leading into room [[10]]
