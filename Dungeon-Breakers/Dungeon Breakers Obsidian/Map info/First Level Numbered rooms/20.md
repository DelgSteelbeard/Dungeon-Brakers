This room a temple of... (awaiting the story). There is a carpet going through the middle of the room. Every fabric present is dyed purple. The pews have cushions on them. The four circles in the corners of the room show the pillars with some arcane symbols etched into them. The remaining red circle shows an altar with a odd looking dagger and a candle holder. A skeleton is leaning on the altar.
