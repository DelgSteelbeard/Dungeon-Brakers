This room is a kitchen, it has all the matters related to food. The wired thing is that despite the supposed age of the dungeon all the food here is relatively fresh. In the middle it has a giant fire pit with a overhead hood leading somewhere, above the fireplace a pork roast. There seems to be some structural damage evident by the rubble in the north-western corner of the room. On the image 2 red circles are present, the one on the left represents wood log piles, fuel for the fire pit and stoves. On the right side bags of flour and or spices.
