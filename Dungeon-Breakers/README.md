# Dungeon-Breakers
Dungeon Breakers will be a 2D turn based game about escaping a dungeon, in this game the player will make their character
and attempt to explore each level of the dungeon in order to find loot, equipment and fight enemies to gain experience.
When the player thinks their character is sufficiently prepared to face the level boss he may attempt to kill it.
Each boss guards the entrance to the next level, each level is harder than the previous one.

The game-play-loop is as follows:
Explore rooms -> fight enemies -> gain loot and experience -> fight the boss -> level up/progress the game
